# Java-Task12
TASK 12: Serialization &amp; Deserialization – Object Persistence

# Student Serialization System (Object Persistence in Java)

## 📌 Project Description
The **Student Serialization System** is a Java console-based application that demonstrates the concepts of serialization and deserialization. It allows storing the state of a `Student` object permanently into a file and restoring it later when required.

This project focuses on object persistence using Java’s `Serializable` interface and stream classes, ensuring secure handling of sensitive data and proper exception management.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand serialization and deserialization in Java  
- To store object data permanently in a file  
- To retrieve stored object data successfully  
- To implement `serialVersionUID` for version control  
- To secure sensitive information using `transient` keyword  
- To handle runtime exceptions effectively  

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Serialize student objects into a file (`student.ser`)  
- Deserialize objects and restore data  
- Implements `Serializable` interface  
- Uses `serialVersionUID` for compatibility  
- Protects sensitive fields using `transient`  
- Handles `IOException` and `ClassNotFoundException`  
- Menu-driven console interface  
- Validates restored data after deserialization
